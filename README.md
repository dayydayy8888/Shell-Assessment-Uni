Task 1- ScriptTask1.txt contains the bash script with notes on creating the tasks from task 1.
Task 2- With the back-up script (Backup.txt file) we create a server (since it was not given to 
us by assignment sheet), we choose a remote directory and a port number. We set the 
conditions for the directory with the use of exits as well.
Then we create the backup process starting stage and make sure to user tar to compress our 
files.
